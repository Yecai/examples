Introduction to the Spring Framework
The Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application
Spring enables you to build applications from plain old Java objects POJOs and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE
Examples of how you as an application developer can benefit from the Spring platform:
Make a Java method execute in a database transaction without having to deal with transaction APIs
Make a local Java method a remote procedure without having to deal with remote APIs
Make a local Java method a management operation without having to deal with JMX APIs
Make a local Java method a message handler without having to deal with JMS APIs
